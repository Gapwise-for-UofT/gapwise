# Architecture and operations

## System shape

Gapwise is a local-first React/Vite application. The browser parses an ACORN calendar, calculates timetable gaps, runs the deterministic UTM route graph, and encrypts private state before optional cloud synchronization. The original file, calculated gaps, and calculated routes do not leave the browser. Microsoft, Google, and GitHub OAuth use Supabase Auth.

Production is built from GitHub `main` by Vercel and served from `https://gapwise.ca`. Private cloud is permanently encrypted-only in source; the legacy plaintext cloud tables and overlap helpers have been retired.

| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI, parsing, gaps, routing, private encryption | Browser                | Guest mode works without Supabase; signed-in private cloud data is encrypted before storage.                          |
| Auth, ciphertext, wrapped keys, relationships  | Supabase               | Owner RLS; no Vercel KEK in the database; Auth boundary uses Turnstile abuse protection.                              |
| Device key broker and common gap               | Vercel Functions       | Verified JWT, caller-scoped Supabase client, KEK; no service role.                                                    |
| Account deletion                               | Supabase Edge Function | JWT required; identity comes from the verified token.                                                                 |

| Supabase Auth mail delivery                    | Resend                 | Verified `auth.gapwise.ca` sending domain; SMTP credentials live only in provider/dashboard secret configuration.     |
| Public status communication                    | Gapwise Docs / Vercel  | `status.gapwise.ca`; operator-maintained, separate project, no synthetic-monitoring/uptime/SLA claim.                 |

### Production hostname map

- `gapwise.ca` — canonical web/PWA application.
- `www.gapwise.ca` — permanently redirects to the canonical `gapwise.ca` path.
- `gapwise-utm.vercel.app` — legacy public hostname permanently redirected to the canonical `gapwise.ca` path.
- `api.gapwise.ca` — public API hostname; `/` redirects to the versioned `/v1` discovery root.
- `ai.gapwise.ca` — Gapwise AI/MCP deployment.
- `docs.gapwise.ca` — developer documentation deployment.
- `status.gapwise.ca` — operator-maintained status communication hosted in the separate docs Vercel project.
- `auth.gapwise.ca` — Resend sending domain used by Supabase custom SMTP; it is not an application website.

## Local setup

Install Bun 1.3.14, then run:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.local
bun run dev
```

`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are optional for guest mode. There is no private-cloud rollout-mode variable anymore. Never place a database password, OAuth secret, Supabase secret/service-role key, SMTP/API credential, KEK or raw DEK in a `VITE_` variable.

## Environment consistency

Use the same public Supabase variable names for development, preview and production. Private functions require server-only `GAPWISE_ACTIVE_KEK_VERSION` plus matching `GAPWISE_KEK_V<n>` Sensitive variables. Preview and production must never share a KEK. Verify names and scopes without printing values.

Keep the production Site URL and redirect allowlists exact. Preview authentication should be enabled only for explicitly trusted preview origins. The production account-deletion Edge Function uses exact-origin CORS; temporary preview origins must be removed immediately after disposable testing.

Supabase custom SMTP uses Resend through the verified `auth.gapwise.ca` sending domain. Treat the SMTP/API credential as a provider secret. If it is ever printed, pasted into chat, committed, logged, or captured in a screenshot, rotate by creating a replacement restricted sending credential, updating Supabase SMTP, verifying the Auth mail path, and only then revoking the old credential unless active compromise requires faster containment.

## Database and Edge Functions

Apply migrations in filename order. Never edit an already-applied migration; add a new migration instead.

```sh
supabase db push
supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/lib/database.types.ts
supabase functions deploy delete-account
```

Review generated type changes before committing. Keep JWT verification enabled for `delete-account`. The hosted Edge Function owns its administrative Supabase credential; Vercel private-cloud functions must not receive a service-role key.

The completed private-cloud migration and KEK recovery/rotation procedures are documented in [`PRIVATE_CLOUD_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`](PRIVATE_CLOUD_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md).

Security, privacy, and availability event handling—including severity, containment and credential decisions, provider escalation, notification decision support, communications, post-incident review, and continuity gaps—is documented in [`INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md). It is a process runbook rather than evidence of an incident, response SLA, or completed recovery exercise.

## Verification

Run the same application gates as CI:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
bun run build
bun run format:check
bunx playwright install chromium webkit
bun run test:e2e
```

The Playwright release suite covers Chromium and WebKit at desktop and phone-sized viewports, including import, timetable, gap/route navigation, malformed input, privacy persistence, PWA/offline-shell behavior, and automated accessibility checks.

For database changes also run the isolated Supabase suite:

```sh
supabase db start
supabase test db
supabase db lint --local --level warning --fail-on error
```

After a production deployment verify the canonical domain, intended GitHub commit, response security headers, Vercel runtime errors, Supabase advisors, fresh-device encrypted restore, same-device local restore, sign-out cleanup, bounded common-gap behavior and account deletion with disposable data where destructive testing is required.

For domain/trust changes also verify only the affected boundaries: canonical redirects, `api.gapwise.ca` discovery behavior, `status.gapwise.ca`, Cloudflare DNS/Email Routing/Turnstile configuration, Resend domain verification/delivery state, and Supabase Auth logs. Never print secret values merely to prove configuration.

Use [`LAUNCH_READINESS.md`](LAUNCH_READINESS.md) before a stable release or major announcement.

## Production monitoring

Keep monitoring lightweight and privacy-preserving:

- review Vercel runtime errors and function status codes after deployments;
- review the currently available Vercel request and runtime diagnostics; the web app does not
  currently initialize Web Analytics, Speed Insights, or product events;
- do not add a duplicate analytics provider without a specific need, privacy review, and CSP review;
- monitor Vercel function invocations/transfer and Supabase database size/egress;
- review Supabase Security and Performance Advisors after migrations;
- review Supabase Auth logs after Auth/SMTP/Turnstile configuration changes;
- check Resend delivery events when authentication mail is implicated;
- verify `status.gapwise.ca` when publishing incident/service communication; its independent
  workflow probes public services every 15 minutes, while private services require operator state;
- watch encrypted revision health with aggregate queries only;
- never dump production ciphertext, timetable plaintext, keys, tokens, emails or relationship contents to logs/analytics;
- do not add polling or background location tracking merely for monitoring.

### Aggregate product measurement proposal

The current app cannot report successful or failed imports, navigation starts, feature adoption,
or broad returning use from product events. `status.gapwise.ca` observes public service health,
not these browser actions. Do not infer student adoption from uptime or hosting request counts.

Before enabling any browser telemetry, review the exact transmitted URL fields, production
dashboard settings, retention, access, and applicable consent requirements. An implementation
should use only fixed event names without timetable, building, room, route, account, or precise
location properties. It should never transmit a raw `.ics` file or use a persistent user identifier.
Vercel's [current custom-events documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/custom-events)
limits custom events to paid plans, so it does not meet Gapwise's free-service constraint today.
Free page-view analytics could be considered separately after route/query redaction and privacy
review; it would not measure import outcomes or navigation starts. Speed Insights could supply
aggregate performance measurements within the free allowance after the same review.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank map:** confirm WebGL 2 and inspect MapLibre worker/style/tile requests. The written route remains the accessible fallback.
- **Sign-in error:** compare the browser origin with Supabase Site URL and exact redirect allowlist. Never use unrestricted wildcards; inspect Supabase Auth logs and Turnstile state when relevant.
- **Auth mail failure:** confirm Supabase custom SMTP remains enabled, Resend still verifies `auth.gapwise.ca`, and delivery logs show the request. Do not expose the SMTP/API credential while debugging.
- **Inbound `@gapwise.ca` mail failure:** inspect the matching Cloudflare Email Routing rule and destination verification; preserve the existing root routing records unless the failure diagnosis requires a reviewed change.
- **Status page wrong/blank:** verify `status.gapwise.ca` is attached to the docs Vercel project and its hostname rewrite serves the dedicated status page rather than the docs homepage.
- **API hostname shows app UI:** verify the `api.gapwise.ca` host-root redirect to `/v1` remains in `vercel.json`; API paths themselves should not be redirected to the app.
- **Cloud controls disabled:** verify the public Supabase variables exist. Guest parsing/routing should still work.
- **Private-cloud API 503:** verify server-only KEK variable names/scopes without revealing values. Never add a Supabase service-role key to Vercel.
- **Encrypted conflict:** keep the valid local record; revision failures are intentional stale-write protection.
- **Direct route 404:** confirm the Vercel SPA rewrite remains configured.
- **Schema mismatch:** compare migration history, live RLS/privileges and regenerated database types before writing data.

## Security expectations

Treat calendar files, OAuth parameters, browser storage, cloud JSON, device public keys and map responses as untrusted. Keep size/count limits, validate decrypted payloads, rely on RLS rather than client filters and grant browser roles only the operations they use.

Gapwise is defense in depth, not E2EE or zero knowledge. A malicious same-origin deployment, compromised browser/device, stolen authenticated session or sufficiently broad simultaneous Supabase/Vercel compromise can expose data in memory or through the trusted key-broker boundary.
