# Gapwise trust and data inventory

**Issue:** AND-156 (AND-131 Phase 1)  
**Evidence snapshot:** core implementation candidate `1e2500784c9e4203e3eebfbe598e8f8ec95d2134`  
**Reviewed:** 2026-08-29  
**Audience:** maintainers and future privacy, security, and institutional reviewers

This is the internal source of truth for what the current core application and its
configuration demonstrate. It is an inventory, not a final privacy policy, legal
opinion, certification, audit report, or claim of University of Toronto approval.
It deliberately records unknowns rather than filling them with assumptions.

**2026-09-24 correction:** the analytics entries below describe an intended integration that was
never mounted in the app. The current web runtime does not initialize Web Analytics, Speed Insights,
or custom product events. Ordinary hosting/provider request metadata remains a separate boundary.

## Claim classes and maintenance rules

Every material statement below has one of these classes:

- **V — implementation/config verified:** demonstrated by repository code,
  migrations, tests, or checked-in configuration at the evidence snapshot.
- **P — process commitment:** a repository instruction or operating procedure;
  source presence does not prove that the process was performed.
- **H — human/provider/legal confirmation required:** cannot be established from
  this repository. Do not publish it as fact until dated evidence is recorded.

Evidence paths are repository-relative and intentionally point to maintainable
source rather than line numbers. Re-review this inventory whenever a data model,
provider, authentication path, analytics integration, AI permission, deletion
path, or recovery process changes. A dependency name alone is not evidence that a
service receives data; runtime imports, endpoints, and configuration were also
checked.

The exact AI, docs, and mobile heads supplied to AND-156 are
`0d9ab27eee275dd816909ff839df967e5a40fb80`,
`e8b9331a24bb5db73bdc778195c0cd77ae4e15f2`, and
`55665d48d9af0d83f6a40f7daf1aad87fe0a3af5`. Those repositories were not present
in this checkout, so their behavior is **not** independently verified here. Any
cross-repository claim is marked H unless the core integration contract itself is
the claim being described.

## System boundaries

- **V:** The original imported ACORN `.ics` file is read and parsed in the browser.
  The parsed schedule may be remembered locally and may enter optional encrypted
  sync, but the original file/blob and source filename are not fields in the
  private payload or current cloud schema. Evidence: `src/lib/ics-parser.ts`,
  `src/features/timetable/import-lifecycle.ts`, `src/hooks/use-preferences.ts`,
  `src/features/security/private-data.ts`,
  `supabase/migrations/20260807132654_remove_schedule_source_filename.sql`.
- **V:** Guest mode does not require Supabase configuration. Guest schedule,
  personal items, preferences, and UI choices can reside in browser storage.
  Evidence: `.env.example`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/hooks/use-preferences.ts`,
  `src/features/personal/persistence.ts`, `src/features/gaps/preferences.ts`.
- **V:** Optional private cloud state is encrypted in the browser with AES-GCM
  before Supabase storage. Vercel is inside the cryptographic trust boundary
  because its key broker unwraps/re-wraps data keys using a server-held KEK. This
  architecture must be called **browser-encrypted** or **browser-side encrypted**,
  not end-to-end encrypted or zero knowledge. Evidence:
  `src/features/security/local-records.ts`,
  `src/features/security/envelope-crypto.ts`,
  `src/features/sync/encrypted-sync-service.ts`,
  `src/server/private-cloud/key-broker.ts`.
- **V:** Foreground location starts only through a live watcher, is reduced to an
  on-campus point or a status, and the watcher is stopped by the returned cleanup
  function. It is not part of the private sync or AI snapshot schemas. Evidence:
  `src/features/routing/live-location.ts`,
  `src/features/security/private-data.ts`, `src/features/ai/snapshot.ts`.
- **V (core contract only):** AI delegation is separate, opt-in, permissioned,
  and uses a minimized snapshot and queued typed actions. Core does not delegate
  friend data, personal-item notes, precise live location, primary encryption
  keys, or identity-provider/OAuth tokens. Academic meetings are not an AI write
  target. Evidence: `src/features/ai/types.ts`, `src/features/ai/snapshot.ts`,
  `src/features/ai/actions.ts`, `src/features/ai/client.ts`.

## Data inventory

“Retention” below describes behavior visible in source, not provider backup or log
retention. “User control” describes shipped core controls or ordinary browser
controls; it is not a legal data-subject-request procedure.

This register distinguishes an actual runtime data recipient from source-data
attribution or development tooling. Legal roles such as “processor” versus
“independent controller” require human/legal review.

No active advertising or payment service, Sentry, PostHog, or direct OpenAI
SDK/integration was found in the core runtime at this snapshot. This is a bounded
code observation, **not** a claim that provider dashboards or the separately
deployed AI repository contain no additional integration. Historical payment-era
schema files remain in migration history for replay provenance, while the current
forward retirement migration removes their live ledger and entitlement objects.
Production was checked before retirement: payment ledgers were already absent and
the legacy entitlement table was empty. This is schema-history context, not an
active payment processor.

## Retention, deletion, and recovery findings

### Verified behavior

- **V:** The account-deletion Edge Function accepts a direct authenticated browser
  session, rejects OAuth/MCP-client tokens, and calls Supabase Auth admin deletion.
  User-owned rows with `on delete cascade` are then database-cascade candidates.
  The current-browser cleanup path removes secure local records and ordinary
  private stores. Evidence: `supabase/functions/delete-account/index.ts`,
  `src/features/auth/AccountSettingsDialog.tsx`,
  `src/features/sync/encrypted-sync-service.ts`, database migrations.
- **V:** Deleting browser/site data alone does not prove cloud account deletion or
  external provider grant revocation. Signing out removes the application session,
  not necessarily identity-provider history.
- **V:** The schema generally stores a current encrypted private record and current
  availability capsule rather than plaintext history. AI actions and audit-like
  community/publisher state are separate exceptions with their own rows.
- **V:** Source-defined expiry exists for friend invites and crowd reports, but
  expiry in query semantics is not evidence that old rows are physically purged.
- **P:** `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md` and `scripts/backup-database.sh` define a
  sensitive logical-backup and disposable restore-drill procedure.
- **H:** No completed backup, off-site encryption, restore drill, provider backup
  retention, RPO, or RTO is proven by repository presence. OAuth configuration,
  DNS, environment secrets, KEKs, provider logs, and non-database settings are not
  recovered by the SQL procedure.

### Deletion limitations to preserve in later public material

1. Account deletion is intended to remove the Supabase auth user and cascading
   application rows, but provider backups/logs may persist according to unverified
   provider practices.
2. Current-browser cleanup does not clear other browsers/devices that are offline.
3. An external AI provider may retain conversation/tool output under the user's
   provider relationship even after the Gapwise delegation is revoked.
4. Expired invites, crowd reports, and rate-limit rows have no verified physical
   purge job in this repository.
5. Publisher audit rows intentionally use restrictive foreign keys and have no
   approved retention/deletion schedule in source.

## Source-visible security and development controls

- **V:** Tenant-scoped tables use RLS/policies and constrained RPCs; privileged
  browser-private APIs reject OAuth client tokens. Database tests cover friend,
  OAuth/MCP, RLS, and deletion isolation. Evidence: `supabase/migrations/`,
  `supabase/tests/database/`, `src/server/private-cloud/auth.ts`.
- **V:** Private records use versioned AES-GCM contexts/AAD, bounded payloads,
  non-extractable browser keys where supported, separate availability keys, and no
  plaintext cloud fallback. Evidence: `src/features/security/`, encrypted-cloud
  migrations and tests.
- **V:** Account deletion is server-only and its service-role credential is not a
  `VITE_` browser variable. Environment guidance prohibits exposing server secrets.
  Evidence: `.env.example`, deletion Edge Function.
- **V:** CI uses read-only repository permissions, pinned third-party Actions,
  frozen dependency installation, production dependency audit, contract checks,
  formatting, typecheck/lint/unit/build for runtime changes, Playwright, isolated
  Supabase tests/lint, and SDK package/consumer checks. Evidence:
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **P/H:** `SECURITY.md`, operational runbooks, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot, and the PR
  checklist define maintenance processes. Their existence does not prove response
  times, review performance, successful recovery, or independent assessment.
- **H:** There is no basis here to claim a penetration test, SOC 2, ISO 27001,
  formal accessibility certification, institutional approval, contractual uptime,
  or any verified incident/legal-request count.

## Safe claim summary for later phases

Subject to re-verification at publication time, the core repository supports these
implementation statements: the app does not request ACORN credentials; the
original `.ics` is parsed in the browser and has no upload/cloud schema; guest mode
is first-class; optional private state is browser-encrypted before Supabase storage;
Vercel remains in the primary cryptographic trust boundary; foreground location is
not background-tracked or included in sync/AI schemas; AI delegation is separate,
opt-in and category-limited; academic meetings are read-only across the current AI
action types; and account deletion has a dedicated browser-session-only server
path.

Do **not** turn those statements into claims of end-to-end encryption,
zero-knowledge operation, certification, independent audit, penetration testing,
provider residency, guaranteed deletion time, legal compliance, official U of T
affiliation, uptime, or zero incidents/requests without the corresponding human or
provider evidence.
