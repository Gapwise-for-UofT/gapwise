# Trust/data inventory provider supplement — 2026-08-30

**Base inventory:** [`TRUST_DATA_INVENTORY.md`](TRUST_DATA_INVENTORY.md)  
**Detailed evidence:** [`PROVIDER_PRIVACY_AUDIT_2026-08-30.md`](PROVIDER_PRIVACY_AUDIT_2026-08-30.md)  
**Core baseline:** `2f76a34e42890eed81947854de56adbb87c0f650`

The base trust/data inventory intentionally left provider/account facts in its human-confirmation column. This dated supplement reconciles the production evidence that became verifiable after that inventory snapshot. It does not rewrite implementation facts from the base inventory and does not turn remaining legal/operator unknowns into assumptions.

If a provider fact below conflicts with an older "confirmation still required" note in the base inventory, use this dated evidence for the 2026-08-30 production state. Re-verify it after plan, provider, OAuth, analytics, map, or deployment changes.

| Supabase backups                      | Provider docs recommend Free projects maintain their own off-site logical backups rather than relying on paid-plan downloadable backup access                                                                                                   | The separate encrypted off-site backup and disposable restore drill; exact provider-internal backup lifecycle beyond documented plan behavior |

## Public-notice reconciliation

The hosted `/privacy` page and root `PRIVACY.md` are updated alongside this supplement to:

- name OpenFreeMap as an actual browser-side map delivery recipient;
- distinguish the absent browser analytics integration from ordinary hosting/runtime logs (corrected 2026-09-24);
- avoid implying that a Canada Central Supabase primary region means all provider processing is Canada-only;
- avoid claiming Vercel Pro/Enterprise DPA coverage for the connected Hobby account; and
- keep provider log/backup retention and external-provider deletion behavior explicitly bounded.

## Remaining human/operator/legal queue

The following remain outside repository proof and should stay open rather than being converted into a compliance claim:

1. verify Vercel Data Preferences and relevant provider/team access controls;
2. determine and put in place any required processor agreements or transfer mechanisms;
3. confirm any required Supabase DPA/account legal-document status;
4. complete the encrypted off-site backup and disposable restore drill;
5. establish the accountable privacy role, monitored request channel, identity-verification/request workflow, and breach record process; and
6. obtain qualified legal review for applicable law, controller/operator identity, lawful bases, territorial scope, rights, transfers, and notification duties.
