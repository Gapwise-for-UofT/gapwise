# Gapwise one-page product overview

> **INTERNAL DRAFT — OWNER REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE SHARING**

## Product and audience

Gapwise is an independent, privacy-focused web application for University of Toronto students. It turns a student-provided ACORN `.ics` timetable export into Today, Timetable, Gap Plan, and campus day-route views. Timetable identity and source-backed building maps support UTM, UTSG, UTSC, and mixed-campus schedules. Reviewed pedestrian routing, entrances, places, and the public campus API currently cover UTM. It is not an official University of Toronto service, and this draft does not claim university review, approval, sponsorship, or endorsement.

## Current product boundary

- Timetable parsing occurs in the browser; the original `.ics` file is not uploaded by the application.
- Guest mode remains useful without an account.
- Optional sign-in uses Supabase Auth with user-selected Google, Microsoft, or GitHub identity providers.
- Optional private cloud state is encrypted in the browser before storage. Gapwise does **not** describe the design as end-to-end encrypted or zero knowledge because the deployed origin/session/key-broker trust boundary remains relevant.
- Live location is opt-in and foreground-only; background tracking is outside the product guardrail.
- Optional AI/MCP delegation is permissioned and separate from public campus APIs and ordinary private account state. The exact delegated-resource contract must be reconciled with the current `ai` deployment before institutional reliance.

## System shape

The browser hosts timetable parsing, user interaction, local state, routing, and private-state cryptography. Vercel serves the web application and server/API surfaces. Supabase provides authentication and optional account/cloud storage. The maintained trust inventory is the authority for current processor/data-category mapping; provider contractual, residency, backup, log-retention, and external-dashboard facts remain qualified wherever that inventory says human/provider confirmation is required.

## Reviewer-relevant safeguards

- Browser-local timetable import and data minimization are core design boundaries.
- Repository safeguards are traceable by category: authorization in `../../tests/private-cloud-api.test.ts`; tenant isolation/RLS in `../../tests/friend-overlap.test.ts` and `../../tests/security.test.ts`; runtime hardening in `../../tests/runtime-security-regressions.test.ts`; dependency and supply-chain controls in `../../tests/security.test.ts` plus the CI production-dependency audit; deployment headers in `../../tests/deployment-security.test.ts`; and private-cloud cryptography/sync in `../../tests/crypto.test.ts`, `../../tests/encrypted-sync-service.test.ts`, and `../../tests/private-cloud-api.test.ts`. The higher-level control map is `../SECURITY_CONTROL_MATRIX.md`. These are repository and CI evidence, not an independent audit or proof of production-only configuration.
- A public vulnerability-disclosure policy and canonical `security.txt` are implemented. GitHub private vulnerability reporting is the preferred private intake when it is available; if it is unavailable, the policy directs reporters to contact the repository owner through the GitHub profile and request a private channel before sending exploit details.
- Incident-response and operational-trust procedures are maintained in `../INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`; a runbook does not prove a response exercise, uptime level, RTO/RPO, or successful recovery.
- A public `/accessibility` statement and internal accessibility evidence worksheet distinguish current automated evidence from unperformed manual/independent assessment.
- A public `/trust` surface summarizes evidence-backed trust boundaries and links to canonical source material.
- Actual backup/restore exercise status must be taken from the relevant retained exercise evidence, not inferred from a runbook or helper script.

## Open institutional-review items

Before institutional reliance, reconcile this package against the exact deployed build and current cross-repository evidence; complete owner/legal/provider confirmations; obtain any institution-specific legal/privacy/security review; and keep independent penetration testing, insurance, certifications, measured service levels, and university authorization explicitly unclaimed unless they actually occur.

See [README.md](README.md) and [EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md](EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md) for current package status and gaps.
