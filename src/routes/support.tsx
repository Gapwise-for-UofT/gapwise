        <h2>AI connector will not connect</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you are signed in to Gapwise.</li>
          <li>Open Gapwise AI settings and enable AI delegation.</li>
          <li>Complete the Gapwise consent screen shown by the AI client.</li>
          <li>Approve only the permissions you actually want to delegate.</li>
          <li>If access was previously revoked, reconnect and authorize the client again.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The canonical remote MCP service is <code>https://ai.gapwise.ca/api/mcp</code>. Supported
          clients should discover the OAuth requirements from that service rather than asking you to
          paste an access token.

      <section>
        <h2>Schedule information is missing</h2>
        <p>
          Confirm that the timetable is present and current inside Gapwise and that the relevant AI
          read permission is enabled. Gapwise intentionally does not invent classes, rooms, routes,
          free time, or gap assessments that are absent from its source-backed state.

      <section>
        <h2>An AI-requested change was rejected</h2>
        <p>
          Supported preference writes are permission-checked and revision-bound. A stale or
          conflicting write can fail even if the assistant expected it to work. Refresh the current
          Gapwise context and retry only if the request still fits. Imported academic meetings
          cannot be created, edited, or deleted through AI integrations.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Disconnect or revoke AI access</h2>
        <p>
          Revoke the connector from Gapwise AI settings. Revocation removes the delegated Gapwise AI
          snapshot and queued bridge actions and prevents subsequent private connector reads or
          writes until you explicitly authorize again. You may also use the connected
          provider&apos;s own connector-management controls.
